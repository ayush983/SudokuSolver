A standalone GUI based sudoku solver in python.

--Logic used:Backtracking
--Module:pygame



You can fill in boxes with numbers of your choice and then let the application solve the rest.

sudoku.py is the program I created first.This contains just the backtracking logic for solving a sudoku board(taken as input).


game.py is the main app coded in pygame.
